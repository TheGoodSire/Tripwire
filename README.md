# Nothing
It's a game about nothing! Or is it?

It’s a game about nothing! Or at least that is what a blink would tell you from it’s perspective. That is because if any input is received by the blink it’s game over. This absurdly simple concept serves as the basis for five new blinks games outlined below, as well as new “cameos” which allow players to modify other games in their existing blinks library. Feel free to modify the rules of these games as you see fit and make them your own. Use this concept to make your own new games, or even to remix existing blinks games. The possibilities are endless….

Firing squad - One player holds their finger on top of a blink in the middle of the table. They can move it, but only gently enough to not activate a button press. All other players slide blinks from the edges of the table trying to kill the center blink. Whoever lands the killing blow takes the new place in the center.

Ninja - Players hold a blink between two fingers in one hand and place it flat on the table with the top button easily accessible to be pressed. Turns go clockwise around the table. On their turn, players can either reposition their blink on the table, or use their other hand to lunge at another players’ buttons. Lunges must be in one motion and can not change direction. A player being attacked can try to dodge, but only after the attacking player is closer than half the distance from where they started. Once a player lunges they are frozen at the end of their lung until their next turn. The next player in the rotation can then take their turn immediately after so game play is lightning fast. Players are eliminated when their blink is pressed.

Minefield - One player closes their eyes while the opposing player arranges all blinks on the table in any configuration they want. The blind player must then quickly press anywhere on the table and hope that they don’t hit a mine. Players alternate roles until someone hits a mine and loses.

Dodge Ball - A childhood classic re-imagined for blinks. Divide your table or play space into two sides and players into two teams. Separate out one blink per player and place the rest on the center line to use as balls. Players hold their finger on top of their player blink and can move it around being careful not to initiate a click. Players use their other hand to grab the remaining ball blinks and slide them at the opposing team’s players to make connections. Players can not cross the mid-line of the play space, or use their hands to block incoming blinks. If their blink goes into death mode they are out.

Blink Blitz - Place blinks in a line one inch apart and try to tap your finger back and forth between them as fast as you possibly can until you trigger a blink. Think those crazy finger knife dodging videos on YouTube. At least here everyone can leave with their fingers intact! Alternate mode - Arrange 4 blinks in a Y configuration and tap quickly between each side.

Cameos:

Flic Flop - Use Nothing blinks as skill obstacles to be avoided when sliding the blinks towards the flopper. Any accidental connections with a Nothing blink cost the team one point.

Astro - Place Nothing blinks amidst the asteroid field to create black holes. Any players or asteroid that connects to a nothing blink enters its pull and becomes unavailable to use the rest of the game.

Heist - Place Nothing blinks around the vault to act as security guards. Any players that accidentally alerts a security guard by connecting to them lose one gold piece.

Dynamo - Power Struggle Remix - Players must find a way to hold a Nothing blink in the same hand as the Dynamo blink while playing power struggle. The normal rules apply, but if the Nothing blink gets triggered or connects to the Dynamo blink the player also loses.

Special thanks to @jrcwest for encouraging me to develop this concept further! Be sure to let me know what games or cameos you come up with, and as always have fun!
